            <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there!  My name is Nicole Fleischman.  I am a bookkeeper by profession.  I've been married to my husband, Cory, since 2018 and we added a loving, spunky chocolate Labrador to our family in 2020 named Silo.  We love him - too much probably.   I love to travel - the newest focus being the National Parks and exploring all that the U.S. has to offer (and boy, there's a lot to see here).  I'm passionate about finance.  I grew up in a family that didn't have much in the way of wealth, but my parents instilled strong values of saving, working hard and being charitable.  To this day, those values stand strong.  My goal as a financial professional is to come alongside business owners, like yourself, and help shift the pressure off of you when it comes to the bookkeeping.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
            <p>I've worked with many different clients in many different industries including construction, residential and commercial leasing, charitable foundations, food service and legal among many others.  In additional to bookkeeping, I have many years of experience in management and consulting on various matters.  I've worked in public accounting and, as a result, know the value of having a bookkeeper who will work in collaboration with your accountant to keep your books in order.</p>
